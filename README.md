## Purpose of the project
---
The users of the site are people who want to learn more about the experiences of other people regarding flying into space, they want to learn more about the Moon and/or Mars. Furthermore, site visitors are able to request more information or book a flight into space. 
The company wants to create more bookings by sharing the experiences of other people, providing more information about the two destinations and to make it easy to book a flight or request more information regarding a departure from several locations in the world.

## Technologies Used
---
*	HTML: was used to create the basic skeleton of the project
*	CSS: was used for styling the pages to make it more attractive for users to visit.

### Framework
*	[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/): the project uses Bootstrap 4.0 to be responsive to screen size and it provides a certain basic structure which saves time.

### Tools
*   [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery): all the icons I used on my website are from here.
*   [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono?query=space+mono&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles): by browsing Google fonts I chose the space mono 400 regular for content and the 700 bold for headers and the menu in general.
*   DevTools: was used for the positioning of features and content while also used during adaptations regarding responsiveness.

### Features for the future
*   Fixed header
*   Drop-down menu
*   Visually improved buttons 
*   Table adjustments
---
## Testing
---
### Supported screens and browsers
*   Desktop: my own screen turns out to be 1366x768 and I started with this screen once I was able to view it in a browser. All the links, buttons and videos worked the way they should.
*   Ipad: I used DevTools to adjust it to the Ipad size. I tested all the links, buttons and videos. They worked.
*   Mobile: the Iphone5 was the basis for adjusting the website to mobile size. At first I hid quote two and review two, but in the end the view allowed for all. Also here everything worked as expected.

*   Chrome: this is the browser I normally use and have used during this project. For the most time I did not have access to the browser view, but via DevTools at the end I was able to see how to adjust for an Ipad screen and mobile (Iphone5) screen. All the links, buttons and videos work.
*   Firefox: for now I only pasted the link in the browser and it showed that the links, videos as well as the buttons were working in the same way.
*   Edge: I tested the links, videos and buttons and they were all working similarly when I pasted the url in this browser.

### Test cases

1.  As a visiting user I want to easily find and read the experiences of other people so that I get an idea of the quality of the service.
    *   Home: on this page we see a header with a logo that links to the homepage. Then a navbar that links to all three pages. The first section header with two quotes and a video. Then another section header with two reviews and a round button with a link to the booking page. Below that a section header with three departure locations. Finally, a footer with the address of the company and four social links. 
    *   As a visiting user, when I visit the [homepage](https://github.com/MoeskerDev/TheExplorationofaLifetime/blob/master/assets/images/DesktopHomeImage.png), I can see the section header and read the reviews below from people who already experienced a flight in an instant on the homepage.

2.  As a visiting user to the website I want to quickly learn more about the Moon and Mars so that I can decide if and which one I want to visit.
    *   Background information: on this page we see the same header and footer. Besides that there is a section header with two informative videos and another round button with a link to the booking page. Below that section header with a table that contains more information regarding the dates, departures, travel time and destination. Below that a section header with three departure locations and at the bottom the footer again with the address of the company and four social links. 
    *   As a visiting user you can learn more about the Moon and Mars by clicking on background information in the navbar which leads to the [background information](https://github.com/MoeskerDev/TheExplorationofaLifetime/blob/master/assets/images/DesktopInfoImage.png) page where you can watch both videos.

3.  As a visiting user to the website I want to be able to navigate directly to the book a flight area so that I don't waste time searching for it.
    *   Book a flight: on this page we have the same header and footer. At the top there is a section header with images of the Moon and Mars including the prices per destination. Below that a header as a question with a form where you can either request more information or leave your info if you want to book a flight. Name, email and the specific request are required. There is a submit button as well. 
    *   As a visiting user you are one click away from booking on each page via the green **_book now_** button or via the booking a flight link in the navbar, as you have seen on the [homepage](https://github.com/MoeskerDev/TheExplorationofaLifetime/blob/master/assets/images/DesktopHomeImage.png) and [background information](https://github.com/MoeskerDev/TheExplorationofaLifetime/blob/master/assets/images/DesktopInfoImage.png) page. When you click on the green button you are directed to the final book a flight page. The same result when you click on the book a flight link in the navbar on any page.
        Directed to the last page, [book a flight](https://github.com/MoeskerDev/TheExplorationofaLifetime/blob/master/assets/images/DesktopBookImage.png), you can fill out the form. 

*   The logo link should direct to the homepage when being clicked on which it does.
*   All the lines/boxes of the form should be filled out since they are required. If not a message should appear to fill out a certain line/box which it does. Once you fill out all the lines before you click on 'I want to fly into space' these warnings should not appear which indeed they do not, as expected.
*   The social links should open in another browser tab once you click on any of the four. All four social links open, as expected, in another browser tab.

### Code validation
*   HTML: was checked and passed the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no issues.
*   CSS: was checked and passed the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no issues.
    *   Please note that I removed my alt text at the images and videos since they came up as errors in the above validators. 

### Fixed Bugs
*   At the homepage for some time I could not get all three features of the first section aligned next to each other. Despite trying first by changing margins and/or padding without DevTools. I realized that the second section did place three similar features next to each other. I compared the code just to realize that the only thing that I needed to change were some end divs! They were not placed correctly around the code so I corrected that.

*   At some point I decided to check my social links and they did not work eventhough I followed a CI tutorial doing this. I did not understand why, looked online and then found a website where they mentioned that you should use the [absolute URL](https://pixelgrade.com/docs/lens/troubleshooting/arent-social-links-not-working/). I adapted the links and after that they worked!

*   Responsiveness; here I still have so much to learn and I think this is what took a lot of time and I am still not satisfied with the results. At the same time I learned a lot playing with the box model. I believe I missed my deadline mainly due to this part (combined with the fact that I was stressed with time anyway). I was proud of creating this neat website (first ever!) with Bootstrap on my own desktop view. Then came responsiveness.. First I started to use both the grid system and the media queries which completely messed up my good looking website. I should have read 2.6 of LO2 more closely. I decided I should go for [media queries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6370690/media-queries-how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile) this time and perhaps later the [grid system](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49308468/setting-bootstrap-col-widths-with-media-queries). Since Bootstrap is mobile first design but my own design was desktop first, mainly made with looking at the preview in gitpod and later luckily looking at it via my own browser, I was confused. I started with min-width, but later realized that even though I used Bootstrap, which is mobile first, my design had been desktop first. So I changed it to max-width. Then to pick the [breakpoints](https://bootstrapcreative.com/bootstrap-4-media-queries/). The idea was to make it fit all the screen sizes on DevTools, but I could not make it due to time. I decided to focus on desktop, Ipad and Mobile (Iphone5) which already created many changes and sometimes challenges for each size. At the final moments there were still always little things to adjust that would not change due to? Although I have to say it always gives a great feeling when I resolve one of my issues and learn more about how it all works.
